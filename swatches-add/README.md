# Script Hero: Swatches Add

These are scripts written with the **Script Hero** library. They are templates for adding Swatches to a document. There is one for each type of Swatch - CMYK, RGB, LAB, and grayscale for both Process & Spot colors. 

- Each starts with a prompt to keep or remove existing Swatches. 
- The `makeSwatch*` utilities support Swatch Groups. 
- Duplicates Swatch and Swatch Group names are avoided. 
- **TIP**: Use a spreadsheet to set these up.
