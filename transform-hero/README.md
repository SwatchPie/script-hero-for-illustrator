# Script Hero: Transform Hero

These are scripts written with the **Script Hero** library. I wrote them to help with patterns and textures. There's one for opacity, rotation, scale, translation, and z-index. The broad ideas are: 

- They each have a ScripUI panel. 
- They work like `Transform Each` on selected items. 
- They can perform set or randomized operations.
- They can undo the operations they perform.
