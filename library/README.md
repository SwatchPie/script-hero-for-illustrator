# Script Hero: Library

This is the heart of Script Hero. It contains the utility functions, tests, and other resources meant to be shared across projects. 

- [library/utilities](./utilities/README.md) - The core of Script Hero. Modules with reusable utility methods that perform specific tasks.
- [library/tests](./tests/README.md) - Every utility module has a corresponding test module and methods. These manual tests demonstrate how a utility is used in a larger script. 
- [library/external](./external/README.md) - External JavaScript libraries.
- [library/actions](./actions/README.md) - Illustrator `actions.aia` files for things that cannot be scripted directly. For example, deleting unused panel items.
- [library/helpers](./helpers/README.md) - Stand-alone, self-executing methods. These are highly specific, limited-use methods that are not intended for use in larger scripts.
