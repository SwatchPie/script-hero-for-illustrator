# Script Hero: Documentation

As a technical writer who works with all kinds of scripts, I aim for just-in-time documentation. I lean towards documenting things in-place and try to minimize the need to leave a project to read documentation. 

So, while there is some informative stuff in this directory, **the most useful info can be found in the files themselves**. 

- Each directory in this repo has a `README` with good-to-know stuff.
- Every `jsx` file has a header with need-to-know information. 
- Utilities are documented in-place using JSDoc and a good amount of commenting. 
- A quick way to see all utilities is to open the module's file, scroll to the bottom, and look at the `return`. 
- Every utility module has a corresponding test module demonstrating how to work with utilities and see what they do.
